description: The man and the woman stood facing one another, although in the uncertain
  firelight which alone illuminated the room neither could see much save the outline
  of the other's form. The woman stood at the further end of the apartment by the
  side of the desk-- his desk. The slim trembling fingers of one hand rested lightly
  upon it, the other was hanging by her side, nervously crumpling up the glove which
  she had only taken off a few minutes before.
